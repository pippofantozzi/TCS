        - **1) Consistent, reliable and instantaneous source of business knowledge:** DeepConsultant will be trained on only the best consultancy advice from TCS to its clients. Where employees 
        might have gaps in knowledge and skills, DeepConsultant will be a one stop shop for the ultimate consultancy suggestion for any given problem, based on TCS history of problem solving.

        - **2) Creative Generation:** By feeding past business knowledge onto the system, DeepConsultant will become a superpowered brain that will be able to see patterns and learn how to solve new 
        problems in logical novel ways. Especially since it now uses additional Machine Learning models to aid in its understanding of how different factors affect desired metrics

        - **3) Client Satisfaction:** With this tool, TCS will be able to offer not only a more speedy response to its clients, especially compared to its competitors, but 
        will offer more reliable and consistent top tier consultancy advice. Whether working with a junior employee or senior, the client will always feel like he got 
        the answer from the best of the best.
